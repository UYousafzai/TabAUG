# TabAUG
The official repository for TabAUG as a package for plug and play usage.

## Note
Currently the code exists as an integrated system for [Deep Splerge](https://github.com/sohaib023/splerge-tab-aug), We're working on making it an augmentation package for table image augmentations including several format support and a simple plug in play into different custom architectures for offering maximum utility.
